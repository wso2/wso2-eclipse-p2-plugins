Provides support for interacting with the p2 provisioning engine
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
<p>
This package specifies API for interacting with the p2 provisioning engine. The engine
is a naive service that blindly performs a set of requested changes to a provisioned
system. No attempt is made to resolve dependencies or determine whether the
resulting system is valid or consistent. It is assumed that the engine client has
crafted a valid provisioning plan for the engine to perform, typically by using a planner
service.
